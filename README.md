1. To interpret user needs, we use user stories to figure out exactly what users want from a program. Once that is understood, the user needs can then be individualy targeted and developed, satsifying the customer's needs.
2. In the future, I hope to use the overall Sprint methodology as well as daily Scrums. Sprints are an effective way to quickly get separate chunks of work done and they help with adaptability and flexibility. As for daily Scrums, they are a great method of communicatiion and increase team cohesion. I hope to use both of these methods in my future career.
3. One of the most important aspects of being a good team member is communication. All the members of a team should be in tune to an extent; having an idea of where everyone else is, if they need help, if they're done, etc is extremely important. Following that, a good team member should know how to work with others. Team members should trust in the team process and do what they're assigned to do and help where needed. They shouldn't "take matters into their own hands" and change things or do things if the team hasn't agreed with it.
